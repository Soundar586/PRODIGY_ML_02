# PRODIGY_ML_02 – Customer Segmentation Project

I) Overview:
This project focuses on grouping customers based on behavioral or demographic features using clustering algorithms. It is part of the Prodigy ML internship series and demonstrates practical unsupervised learning.

II) Project Structure:

III) Dataset:
Describe the dataset you used:
- Source (e.g., Kaggle, company data, synthetic)
- Sample size and key features (e.g., age, income, purchase frequency, etc.)
- Any preprocessing steps (cleaning, handling missing data, normalization)

IV) Setup & Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soundar586/PRODIGY_ML_02.git
   cd PRODIGY_ML_02
   ```

2. Install necessary packages (Python 3.x):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

3. Launch and explore the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project02_Grouping_Customers.ipynb
   ```

V) Methodology:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualize feature distributions
   * Identify patterns and outliers

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Normalize or scale data
   * Handle categorical variables as needed

3. **Clustering Algorithms**

   * Apply K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, or similar
   * Use elbow method or silhouette score to determine optimal clusters

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**

   * Plot cluster centroids and decision boundaries
   * Analyze characteristics of each cluster

VI) Results:

* **Optimal cluster count**: e.g., 4 clusters
* **Cluster insights**:

  * Cluster 0: High spending, frequent buyers
  * Cluster 1: Low spenders, infrequent buyers
  * (Customize based on your findings)

VII) Next Steps:

* Experiment with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN)
* Introduce feature engineering or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
* Use clustering output for targeted marketing or personalized recommendations
